<h1>Hi, I'm Abhilasha Kumar</h1>
<p>I'm a graduate student at <em>Washington University in St Louis</em> </p>
<p> I work in the <a href="http://psychnet.wustl.edu/coglab/" target="_blank">Cognitive Psychology Lab</a> with Dr. David Balota, on lexical retrieval processes, semantic memory structure and age-related changes in word retrieval processes. </p>
<p> My research explores how words and concepts are organized and accessed through the mental lexicon, and essentially seeks to answer two questions. </p>
	<p> <strong> (1) At the small scale, what is the mechanism underlying lexical retrieval? </strong> </p> 
<p> 		In this line of research, I am interested in understanding the complex interactions between syntax, semantics and phonology in successful or and unsuccessful retrieval. We study the combined influence of semantics and phonology on lexical retrieval using priming paradigms. 
<p> <strong> (2) At the large scale, how does the structure of semantic memory impact cognition? </strong> </p>
<p>		I am also interested in macro-level effects of semantic memory structure on cognitive performance. In the lab, we study how different structural properties of semantic networks may differentially influence performance in several behavioral tasks. For instance, is semantic memory structure better represented through free association, or co-occurrence norms? We also study the extent to which structural properties such as path length influences performance in tasks like relatedness judgments, visual word recognition and lexical retrieval.
